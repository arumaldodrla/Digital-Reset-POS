# Product Overview: Universal Offline POS

## 1. Problem Statement

Retail and restaurant businesses require a reliable, modern, and flexible Point of Sale (POS) system that can operate seamlessly in any environment, with or without an internet connection. Traditional POS systems are often expensive, hardware-dependent, and lack the flexibility to integrate with modern cloud services. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are particularly affected, as they need a cost-effective solution that can scale with their growth and adapt to changing market demands.

## 2. Vision Statement

To provide a universal, offline-first POS system that empowers retail and restaurant businesses with a modern, flexible, and cost-effective solution. Our vision is to create a platform that is:

- **Accessible**: Runs on any modern web browser as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
- **Reliable**: Works 100% offline, with seamless data synchronization when a connection is available.
- **Flexible**: Integrates with a wide range of third-party services for inventory, e-commerce, loyalty, and payments.
- **Scalable**: Supports businesses of all sizes, from single locations to multi-tenant enterprises.
- **AI-Driven**: Designed for 100% AI-assisted development, deployment, and maintenance.

## 3. Key Product Principles

- **Offline-First**: The POS must be fully functional without an internet connection. All core operations, including sales, refunds, and inventory management, are performed on the local device and synchronized with the cloud when a connection is available.
- **Open and Extensible**: The system is built on an open architecture with well-defined APIs and integration points, allowing for easy customization and extension.
- **No Processor Lock-In**: Merchants can choose their preferred payment processor and are not locked into a specific vendor.
- **Multi-Tenant SaaS**: The platform is designed as a multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution, with strong data isolation between tenants.
- **Integration-Native**: The system is designed to integrate seamlessly with a wide range of third-party services, providing a unified and comprehensive solution for businesses.
